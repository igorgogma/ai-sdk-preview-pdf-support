      MATHEMATICAL NOTATION REQUIREMENTS:
      CRITICAL: For all mathematical formulas, equations, and expressions, use proper LaTeX notation with dollar signs.

      ALWAYS USE BRACES FOR SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS:
      - Use $v_{0}$ instead of $v_0$
      - Use $a_{x}$ instead of $a_x$
      - Use $F_{net}$ instead of $F_net$
      - Use $10^{-3}$ instead of $10^-3$
      - Use $\theta^{\circ}$ for degrees, not $\theta^\circ$ or $\theta\circ$

      CRITICAL FOR PHYSICS FORMULAS:
      - For angles with velocity: ALWAYS separate angle and variable with a space: $45^{\circ} \cdot v_{0}$ not $45^{\circ}v_{0}$
      - For equations with exponents: ALWAYS use braces: $20^{0}$ not $20^0$
      - For double exponents (like degrees with variables): ALWAYS use proper spacing: $45^{\circ} \cdot v_{0}^{2}$ not $45^{\circ}v_{0}^{2}$
      - For fractions with variables: ALWAYS use braces: $\frac{1}{2}g(v_{\text{total}})^{2}$ not $\frac{1}{2}g(v_total)^2$
      - ALWAYS use braces for ALL subscripts and superscripts without exception
      - ALWAYS use \text{} for text within math: $v_{\text{total}}$ not $v_{total}$
      - NEVER place exponents directly next to variables with subscripts without proper spacing

      ALWAYS USE PROPER LATEX COMMANDS FOR FUNCTIONS:
      - Use $\cos(\theta)$ instead of $cos(\theta)$
      - Use $\sin(\theta)$ instead of $sin(\theta)$
      - Use $\tan(\theta)$ instead of $tan(\theta)$
      - Use $\log(x)$ instead of $log(x)$

      ALWAYS USE PROPER LATEX COMMANDS FOR GREEK LETTERS:
      - Use $\theta$ instead of $theta$
      - Use $\alpha$ instead of $alpha$
      - Use $\omega$ instead of $omega$

      EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMATTING:
      - "The velocity is $v = 5$ m/s"
      - "The initial velocity is $v_{0} = 10$ m/s"
      - "The angle is $\theta = 30^{\circ}$"
      - "The acceleration is $a = 9.8$ m/s$^{2}$"
      - "The formula $F = ma$"
      - "The equation $E = mc^{2}$"
      - "The horizontal component is $v_{x} = v_{0}\cos(\theta)$"
      - "The vertical component is $v_{y} = v_{0}\sin(\theta)$"
      - For complex equations, use double dollar signs: "$$E = \frac{V}{r} \ln\left(\frac{d}{r}\right)$$"

      Always wrap mathematical symbols, variables, and equations in dollar signs ($...$) for inline formulas or double dollar signs ($$...$$) for displayed equations.

The key insight is that...\n\n**Step 3: Application of relevant formula**\nWe can apply the formula $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ to calculate the kinetic energy. This formula is derived from...\n\n**Step 4: Calculation process**\nSubstituting the values: $m = 2$ kg and $v = 5$ m/s, we get:\n$E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 5^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 25 = 25$ J\n\n**Step 5: Evaluation of options**\nOption A (25 J) matches our calculation and is correct.\nOption B (50 J) is incorrect because it fails to include the $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor in the kinetic energy formula.\nOption C (10 J) is incorrect because it uses the wrong value for velocity.\nOption D (5 J) is incorrect because it confuses kinetic energy with momentum.\n\n**Step 6: Broader context**\nThis concept relates to the conservation of energy principle in the IB Physics curriculum, specifically under Topic 2.3...\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nKinetic energy depends on both mass and the square of velocity, making velocity changes more significant than mass changes for the same proportional change."

It represents the total heat content of a system at constant pressure.\n\n**Step 1: Etymology and historical context**\nThe term 'enthalpy' comes from the Greek word 'enthalpein' meaning 'to heat'. It was introduced by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1909 to...\n\n**Step 2: Mathematical definition**\nEnthalpy is defined by the equation $H = U + PV$, where:\n- $H$ is enthalpy (measured in joules, J)\n- $U$ is internal energy (J)\n- $P$ is pressure (pascals, Pa)\n- $V$ is volume (cubic meters, mÂ³)\n\n**Step 3: Physical interpretation**\nEnthalpy represents the total heat content available in a thermodynamic system. The key insight is that...\n\n**Step 4: Relationship to other thermodynamic properties**\nEnthalpy is related to Gibbs free energy ($G$) through the equation $G = H - TS$, where $T$ is temperature and $S$ is entropy. This relationship is important because...\n\n**Step 5: Applications in chemistry**\nIn chemical reactions, we often measure the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) rather than absolute enthalpy. For a reaction at constant pressure, $\\Delta H$ equals the heat transferred ($q_p$): $\\Delta H = q_p$. This is crucial for understanding...\n\n**Step 6: Standard enthalpy of formation**\nThe standard enthalpy of formation ($\\Delta H_f^\\circ$) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound forms from its elements in their standard states. For example...\n\n**Step 7: Connection to IB curriculum**\nIn the IB Chemistry curriculum, enthalpy is covered in Topic 5 (Energetics/Thermochemistry) and is fundamental to understanding...\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nEnthalpy is a state function that helps us track energy changes in chemical and physical processes, particularly useful for processes occurring at constant pressure like most laboratory reactions."

            ],
            "explanation": "**Correct Answer: $E = 4.5 \\times 10^{17}$ J**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the physical principle**\nThis problem involves Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, expressed by the equation $E = mc^2$. This fundamental relationship in physics shows that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted from one form to another. The equation states that the energy ($E$) equivalent to a mass ($m$) equals the mass times the speed of light squared ($c^2$).\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the relevant variables**\nIn this problem, we have:\n- Mass: $m = 5$ kg\n- Speed of light: $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n- We need to find: Energy ($E$) in joules (J)\n\n**Step 3: Setting up the calculation**\nWe'll use the formula $E = mc^2$ directly. This formula comes from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity (1905) and represents one of the most famous equations in physics. It's important because it shows that even a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the square of the speed of light**\nFirst, we need to calculate $c^2$:\n$c^2 = (3 \\times 10^8)^2 = 9 \\times 10^{16}$ mÂ²/sÂ²\n\nThis step is crucial because the speed of light is extremely large, and when squared, it becomes even more significant, explaining why nuclear reactions release so much energy from small amounts of mass.\n\n**Step 5: Multiplying by the mass**\nNow we multiply the mass by $c^2$:\n$E = m \\times c^2 = 5 \\times 9 \\times 10^{16} = 45 \\times 10^{16} = 4.5 \\times 10^{17}$ J\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing the units**\nLet's verify that our units are correct:\n- Mass is in kg\n- Speed of light squared is in mÂ²/sÂ²\n- When multiplied: kg Ã mÂ²/sÂ² = kgÂ·mÂ²/sÂ² = J (joules)\n\nThis dimensional analysis confirms our answer has the correct units of energy.\n\n**Step 7: Contextualizing the result**\nTo understand the magnitude of this energy, let's compare it to something familiar. This amount of energy (4.5 Ã 10Â¹â· J) is approximately equivalent to the energy released by 100 megatons of TNT, or about 2,000 times the energy of the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated (Tsar Bomba). This demonstrates why nuclear reactions, which convert small amounts of mass to energy, can release such enormous amounts of energy.\n\n**Common mistake to avoid:** Students often forget to square the speed of light or make errors in scientific notation when dealing with such large numbers. Always be careful with exponents when calculating with very large or small numbers.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nEinstein's equation $E = mc^2$ demonstrates the fundamental equivalence of mass and energy, showing that a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy. This principle underlies nuclear reactions and explains why they can produce such vast amounts of energy compared to chemical reactions."
